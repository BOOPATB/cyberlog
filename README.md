# What  Learned
Native vs Cross‑Platform
- Native apps use platform‑specific languages (Kotlin/Java for Android, Swift/Objective‑C for iOS) and give best performance.
- Cross‑platform apps (like Flutter) use a single codebase (Dart) to target Android, iOS, web, and desktop.

Hot Reload
- Hot Reload lets me change code and see UI updates almost instantly without restarting the whole app.
- This makes experimenting with layouts, colors, and logic much faster.

Widgets
- In Flutter, everything is a widget: text, buttons, rows, columns, containers, and even the whole app.
- There are StatelessWidgets (no internal state) and StatefulWidgets (can update when state changes).

 Installing Flutter and Runiing the App
1. Install Flutter  
   - Download Flutter SDK for Windows and extract it to: `C:\Users\HP\Desktop\flutter`  
   - Add this path to the User PATH environment variable: `C:\Users\HP\Desktop\flutter\bin`
2. Check the setup
