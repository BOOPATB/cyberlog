Dart's compilation process utilizes both Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation during development for fast iteration (like Hot Reload) and Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation for the final release app to ensure peak performance and speed. The core logic of the Ccurrent app, checking if the summed ASCII value of a string is even or odd, uses a concise Ternary Conditional Operator (String parity = number % 2 == 0 ? 'even' : 'odd';). This short syntax checks if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is zero. to present a  clean, understandable result, String Interpolation is used. Instead of messy concatenation, variables ($input, $number, and $parity) are embedded directly into the final output string, making the result text highly readable and easy to construct.
