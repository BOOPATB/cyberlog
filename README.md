## What I Learned
- **Native vs Cross‑Platform:** Native apps use Kotlin/Android Studio or Swift/Xcode with best performance but separate codebases. Cross‑platform tools like Flutter, React Native, Xamarin, and Ionic use one codebase for multiple platforms.
- **Why Flutter:** Single Dart codebase for Android, iOS, web, and desktop. Uses its own Skia engine for consistent, high‑performance UIs. Everything is a widget, making layouts flexible and customizable.
- **Hot Reload & Widgets:** Hot Reload updates UI in milliseconds without a full restart, speeding up experimentation. Flutter apps are built from a widget tree using StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget.

# Setup & First App
1. Install Flutter SDK and add `flutter\bin` to PATH.  
2. Install Android Studio (SDK, platform tools, AVD) and Flutter/Dart plugins.  
3. Run:
  Fix any red errors.  
4. Create and run a sample app: It shows a simple “If Lost, Contact” screen using `MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, and a centered `Text` widget.
